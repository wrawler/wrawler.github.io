Unfortunately, right now I have no idea what to put as my first line. But, let me start with telling you why you would be interested in yet another self-proclaimed developer's blogs. (*Spoiler* - It's going to be fun)

Its a general consensus, that software developers are creatures of solitude, which should not be disturbed in their habitats. As much as I agree with that statement or meme (if you will), I believe that people who believe that they were born to enter the tech industry, should not gatekeep themselves from creative fields. A succesful software developer in my understanding (not that I would call myself one, on the day I am writing this) is someone who can be creative enough to accomplish as task which seemed impossible.

In our daily lives, we have to write loads of documentation anyways, why not try writing about yourself, your thinking process during an ongoing project or endevour ? 

The 10-year old me in 2015, used to be so engrosed in a children books series called **Geronimo Stilton**, that I would borrow a new book twice a week, and read it secretly during my tuition classes (I hope my mother doesn't read these blogs). That seemingly easy-to-read "children's" book series, got me into reading early on. Crazy that today its hundreds or thousands of line of code, instead of a simple book. I would even write some short stories, which to none's surprised had a lot of rodent characters. 

Cut to today, its 2025, I am a Second-year student at my University, middle of planning my future and am getting back into writing. These blogs are not just my thoughts or devlogs, this is a time capsule to observe the journey of a college student trying to enter the world of tech corporates, where everyone wants to hire a senior dev. 

I am going to ensure, that you as a reader gets an honest and fun experience browsing through these blogs. Just hop on the bandwagon and see where this takes you.
